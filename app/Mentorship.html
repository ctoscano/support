                  I am ten years older than my brother. When I was his age, I was in my first year at MIT.
                  I felt so lucky.

              <p>
                This is my brother Nick. I think he is lucky too. I am teaching him a lot of what I learned at MIT,
                and a lot I wished I learned back then so that he'll be prepared when he goes to college.
              </p>
              <p>
                He has blossomed since living with me. I had no idea he would change so much over such a short period of time.
              </p>
              <p>
                We made a deal with each other, that we would take what we learned through this experience and share it
                with our family and friends. We want to share our luck with other people.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here it is, my attempt to share the best of what we have learned, to convince you to be a mentor, to
                seek a mentor, and to give you something to start with. Please let me know what you think.

              <p>
                Mentoring is the best way I can help people I care about fulfill their potential,
                and it's my most reliable source of happiness and fulfillment.
              </p>

                Resistance to change is the greatest mentoring challenge, and I am convinced that this resistance can be
                addressed by observing and defining identity, setting a productive mindset, and journaling to
                observe, celebrate, and remember progress.

              Mentorship relationships could last a lifetime or a moment. Mentors can be a sibling or a cousin, a peer or a teacher.
              Mentors can share something in a moment that will replay in our minds again and again if they just
              took the time to learn about us and share their thoughts.

              I saw as my little brother began to realize that he could understand things by learning about them, that he
              was quite capable of learning how to do things that mattered. He realized he could really get better with
              practice, and finally to believe that all he needed was time.

            <p>
              I know I made a difference in his life, and that makes me happy. More than that, I know he will keep
              learning, and because of that he will be a better friend, mentor, and father one day. That gives me
              immense satisfaction.

                They’re often surprised at how much they learn from their mentees. Mentoring really goes both ways;

              The biggest obstacle I see to personal and professional growth is our natural resistance to change. We are hard-wired
              to learn and to grow. At the same time, we feel the need to be loved and accepted just as we are.
              This conflict causes discomfort that triggers resistance.

              We can feel blame for needing to change, guilt for not having changed already, or fear that we won't be
              able to change, triggering more discomfort and more resistance.
              We criticise the advice and even the motives of the adviser to justify dismissing the advice and restoring our
              sense of self.

              Our identity is our self-image. If we were a character on TV, our identity would help us predict what
              our character would do in each scene. Does our character read before bed? Would our character exercise or
              journal in the morning? Would they learn to play an instrument?
            </p>
            <p>
              When giving advice, just being aware that identity and self-esteem are important parts of difficult conversations can really help.
            </p>
            <p>
              We can grow and stay true to our identity. We can expand our character to include what we learn and how we
              chose to be. We can learn and craft ourselves as long as we are mindful of our resistance, listen and
              speak compassionately, and set our minds to it.

              There is a subtle difference in how we evaluate ourselves or give encouragement to others that has a

              Realizing that a person's true potential is unknowable had a profound effect on my brother. Dweck put it best,

            <p>
              You can help yourself and others unleash that passion for learning by
              thinking of intelligence and personality as something you can develop, not fixed. By taking on a growth
              mindset, challenges become opportunities to learn, and potential is not measured by performance, but
              determined by the will to keep working at it.

            </h3>
            <p>
              Journaling enables you to peer inside of your own mind, to be a visitor, to observe your thoughts and feelings.
              There is no better way to get to know yourself aside from meditation.

              Meditations of Marcus Aurelius offers a glimpse into the mind of the last grand Roman Emperor and accomplished
              philosopher.

              Through Aurelius's writing we hear his voice as he would speak with himself. We see what he sees and are
              given an appreciation for the things he thinks are important. Book I is dedicated to listing his
              mentors, and the lessons they gave him.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>From my great-grandfather: not to have attended schools for the public; to have had good teachers at home,
              and to realize that this is the sort of thing on which one should spend lavishly.</p>
              <footer>Marcus Aurelius, Roman Emperor and Philosopher, in <cite title="Meditations">Meditations</cite></footer>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              I have to remind myself that he wrote
              believing he was his only audience.
              If a Roman Emperor would make the time to journal while on campaign, he must have thought it was
              a valuable enough exercise to spend the time to do it.
            </p>
            <p>
              As I began journaling I became suddenly aware of unexpected benefits. My thoughts slowed down as I wrote, and
              letting me think about better wording. It took so long to write a down a thought that I was
              much more selective. The permanence of the ink on paper made more careful with each stroke. I started
              reading my writing and could see where I was being impractical or unobservant.
            </p>
            <p>
              Taking a moment to describe the events in my life made them more real. I took the time to describe the
              sights and the smells, to try and record the feeling of those meaningful moments in my life.

              I have always had a terrible memory,
              but now I know that I missed those memories because I didn't take the time to think about them.
            </p>
            <p>
              The act of building the habit to journal as a worthwhile exercise in building a habit. Once we choose
              our identity, it is only through the building of habits do we overcome old habits and reinforce the
              character we chose to play.
